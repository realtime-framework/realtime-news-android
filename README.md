## Realtime News for Android (Java)
The Realtime Code Hosting service provides you an easy way of executing server-side scripts without the need of managing the required infrastructure. You write the code and Realtime takes care of all the backend heavy-lifting issues.

To illustrate the main concepts we've built an enterprise mobile app. This repository contains the Android version of the app where you're able to browse the contents and get GCM notifications whenever new content is published.
